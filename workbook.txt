Subject: Checking In on Sprinter Loads

Good morning, Derick and David,

I hope you're doing well. We recently delivered a load for you from TN to KY, and I wanted to follow up with a friendly reminder that we have Sprinter van capacity available nationwide.

We offer competitive rates and exceptional service.
Our dispatch and tracking teams handle every detail of the load, providing real-time updates from pickup to delivery.

Feel free to reach out anytime via email or direct phoneâ€”I'm available 24/7 to assist with any of your shipping needs.

Have a great weekend.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Good morning,

Thank you for the quote!
Unfortunately, we primarily operate as a cargo van carrier and do not have any 26ft trucks available in California at this time.

We appreciate the opportunity and hope to work together in the future.
